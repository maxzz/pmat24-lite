Option  Description

Enable password policy
        When enabled:
            If the password is entered by the user, it will be verified by Password Manager and must conform 
            to the password complexity requirements defined in this dialog.

            If the password is generated by the system, it will be generated according 
            to the specified complexity requirements.

Complexity

Predefined rule
        The password must conform to the predefined rule selected from the
        dropdown menu. These include:

        Letters and numbers - 
            allows any combination of letters and/or numbers. Numbers only - allows numbers only.

        Letters only - 
            allows letters only.

        Letters or numbers with special characters - 
            passwords must contain at least one number or letter and at least one special character. 
            Special characters include !\"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?[\\]^_`{|}~@. Spaces are not allowed.

        Letters or numbers with at least one number - 
            passwords may contain either letters or numbers with at least one number.

Custom rule
        Enter a pattern for verifying or generating a password using the following notation:
            A = UPPERCASE LETTERS, i.e. A through Z
            a = lowercase letters, i.e. a through z d = digits, i.e. 0 through 9
            s = special characters, i.e. !”#$%&’()*+,?./:;??@[\]^_`{|}~
            ( ) = Use the enclosed indicators in random order.
                For example: (asd) would require or generate a password with a lower case letter, a special character and a digit in any order, i.e. b$3, #1f or 0z! But the use of asd without the parentheses would always have a lowercase character first, a special character second and then a number.
            [ ] = Define a custom character set i.e. [abcdef] would limit the user to only those letters in the specified position.
                For example: A custom rule of [abcd]ds would generate only passwords with a, b, c or d in the first position, a digit in the second position and a special character in the third position.
            {n,m} Define a range of acceptable occurrences of the previously indicated character set.
                For example: d{2,4}a{2,}s{3} indicates 2 to 4 digits followed by 2 or more lower case letters and 3 special characters.
                Note that when there is a comma but no upper range defined, as in {2,}, then the upper limit is only constrained by the maximum length of the password as specified in the field described below.
                When only one value is specified - without the comma, as in {3}, then the lower and upper range are the same, i.e. in this case, exactly 3 special characters.
            ~ = Prevent two identical consecutive characters
                For example: This symbol would prevent passwords such as abCCd or fkiq&33.
            & = Prevent a character being in the same position as in the most recent password
                For example: This symbol would prevent using the password abc3def if the most recent previous password was dar3feg.

Length
        Select the minimum and maximum length for the password. Note that any
        custom rule defined must fall within the range between the minimum and maximum lengths specified here.

Test Complexity
        This area includes two fields and buttons which can be used to verify that a specific password meets 
        the defined complexity requirements or generate a new password that will meet the requirements.

        Verify - 
            Enter a password in the text field to the left of the Verify button and it will be verified against the defined complexity rule.
        Generate - 
            Click the Generate button and the system will generate a password that conforms to the defined complexity 
            requirements and display it in the field to the left of the button.

History
        From this dropdown menu, you can select additional password constraints relating to the history of the password.

        None - 
            No other constraints are applied to the password contents.
        Different than the Windows password - 
            The new password must be different than the current Windows password.
        Unique within Password Manager managed logons - 
            The new password must be different from any other password associated with this managed logon for a specified user account.
        Different than the current password - 
            The new password must be different than the current password for this website or program

        Note that the History constraints are not applied when verifying or generating passwords within this dialog, 
        but only on an actual Change Password screen.

Generation
        By User - 
            Password Manager does NOT provide password information to a
            Change Password screen and the user has the option to log on by entering their password 
            or another allowed credential. If a password is used, it is verified against the defined complexity rules.

        By System - 
            Password Manager generates the password automatically. An alternate credential must be used to log on.
